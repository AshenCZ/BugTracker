Main todo:
==========

  Memory representation
    * The loaded bugs vector<>   .. OK-ish, refactor
    * The labels of collumns     .. OK
    * The states                 .. OK

  Loading from DB
    * load collumn names for treeView                             .. OK
        * labels below need to change, labels in preview window   .. POSTPONED
    * load state names (like critical, normal, etc.)              .. OK
        * type enum list in filter needs to change                .. OK
    * load the bugs correctly
        * loaded into memory                                      .. OK, load_query_intoMemory() loading six, not col_count_
        * correct things in correct collumns

  TreeWidget  -  OnClick
    * should update the description on the right

  TreeWidget  -  OnDoubleClick
    * should open a dialog to edit the bug

  DB is connecting to the preset, not to the .ini

  Settings do not update .ini file (or load it's data to show before edit!!)

  Filter on the bottom is not filtering

  Recognize enum types when parsing bugs

  Concurrent access not solved at all (yet)

  Rewrite "Error executing querry" messages

Garbage:
========

  MainWindow::SignalTry() is a prototype
    * to be used with TreeWidget::OnItemDoubleClick
