# BugTracker

This is my project done for **Charles University, Faculty of
Mathematics and Physics** for a beginner course in **C++**.

It is a simple bug tracking software using ```PostgreSQL``` and ```Qt``` allowing the user to simply connect to a bug database and manage the bugs - add new ones, view, edit and filter existing ones.
