# BugTracker

Hello! This is my project done for **Charles University, Faculty of
Mathematics and Physics** for a beginner course in C++.

It is a simple bug tracker using _PostgreSQL_ and _Qt_ allowing the user
to simply connect to a bug database and manage the bugs - add, view, edit.

The project will be evolving during winter 2015 and spring 2016.
